Either way, the results aren't as nice as they could be, so there's a little bit of CSS glue to get everything as desired."

Unfortunately it relies on the fact that you're actually rendering the IPython notebook as HTML. A nicer approach would be to describe the table itself in markdown, which would allow tools like nbconvert to render it correctly in any format."
